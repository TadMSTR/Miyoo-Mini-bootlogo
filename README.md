# Miyoo-Mini-bootlogo
This worked for me, however use at your own risk. I am not responsible for any bricked devices.
  
This will flash the Miyoo Mini bootlogo to the one provided.  
  
You only need to run this once. Remove from your sdcard when you are done.  
  
Place the folder and all of its contents into the App folder on your sdcard. Boot into OnionOS, go to Apps, and run.
  
I made this for OnionOS. I do not know if it will work in MiniUI.
