# Miyoo-Mini-bootlogo
This worked for me, however use at your own risk. I am not responsible for any bricked devices.
  
This will flash the Miyoo Mini bootlogo to the one provided.  
  
You only need to run this once. Remove from your sdcard when you are done.  
  
Place the folder and all of its contents into the App folder on your sdcard. Boot into OnionOS, go to Apps, and run. There are 2 folders, BMO-bootlogo is just the BMO face in gameboy green. It will only flash that. DIY-bootlogo is BMO's normal color but does the full process so you can replace the bootlogo.jpg with whatever you want to use, making sure it is a 640x480 jpg file, upside down.
  
I made this for OnionOS. I do not know if it will work in MiniUI.
