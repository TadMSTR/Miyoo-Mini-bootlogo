# Miyoo-Mini-bootlogo
I have not tested this yet. Use at your own risk. I am not responsible for any bricked devices.
  
This will flash the Miyoo Mini bootlogo to the one provided. If you wish to use your own then make sure it is 640x480, upside down and saved as jpg.  
  
You only need to run this once. Remove from your sdcard when you are done.  
  
Place the folder and all of its contents into the App folder on your sdcard. Boot into OnionOS, go to Apps, and run.
  
I made this for OnionOS. I do not know if it will work in MiniUI.
